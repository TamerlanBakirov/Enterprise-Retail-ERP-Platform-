## 6. Success Criteria for MVP

| Criterion | Target | Measurement |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| POS transaction speed | < 2 seconds end-to-end | Automated performance test |
| RS.GE waybill success rate | > 99% (excluding RS.GE downtime) | Monitoring dashboard |
| RS.GE invoice upload compliance | 100% within 30-day deadline | Deadline monitoring |
| System uptime | > 99.5% (MVP target) | Uptime monitoring |
| Daily closing accuracy | 100% balance | Reconciliation report |
| Concurrent cashier support | 50+ (MVP) | Load test |
| Product catalog | 100,000+ products | Database count |
| Data integrity | Zero lost transactions | Audit log verification |

---

## 7. Key Risks to Timeline

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| RS.GE API documentation gaps | High | Early prototype, contact RS.GE support, community resources |
| RS.GE testing environment access | High | Request staging access early, build mock service |
| SOAP complexity in .NET 9 | Medium | Evaluate WCF Core vs HttpClient approach early |
| Payment terminal integration | Medium | Identify terminal provider early, get SDK |
| Georgian localization complexity | Medium | Involve Georgian-speaking team member from start |
| Receipt printer compatibility | Low-Medium | Test with common Georgian retail printers |
| Regulatory changes during development | Low | Configuration-driven compliance rules |

---

## 8. Definition of Done (Architecture Approval Gate)

Before proceeding to code implementation, the following must be approved:

- [x] Business Analysis Document
- [x] Solution Architecture Document
- [x] Database Design Document
- [x] RS.GE Technical Analysis & Compliance Risk Assessment
- [x] MVP Definition & Development Roadmap (this document)
- [ ] **Stakeholder sign-off on architecture**
- [ ] **Stakeholder sign-off on MVP scope**
- [ ] **Stakeholder sign-off on technology stack**
- [ ] **Stakeholder sign-off on timeline and budget**

**Once all sign-offs are received, Sprint 1 begins.**
